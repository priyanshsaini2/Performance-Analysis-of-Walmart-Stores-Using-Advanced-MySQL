# Sales Performance Analysis of Walmart Stores Using Advanced MySQL Techniques

## Overview

This project analyzes the sales performance of Walmart stores using advanced SQL queries on a structured transactional dataset. The dataset includes customer demographics, product lines, sales figures, and payment methods across multiple branches and cities. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can help Walmart optimize its sales strategies, improve customer segmentation, and identify operational efficiencies.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* Identify the top-performing branch based on sales growth rate.
* Determine the most profitable product line per branch.
* Segment customers based on spending behavior.
* Detect anomalies in transaction data.
* Analyze city-wise payment method preferences.
* Understand gender-based sales distribution over months.
* Examine product line preferences by customer type.
* Identify repeat customers within a specific time frame.
* Find the top 5 customers by revenue contribution.
* Analyze sales trends by the day of the week.

## Dataset

The dataset contains Walmart transactional data and includes fields such as:

* Invoice ID
* Branch
* City
* Customer Type
* Gender
* Product Line
* Unit Price
* Quantity
* Tax
* Total
* Date
